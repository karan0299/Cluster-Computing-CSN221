## Cluster-Computing-CSN221
#### **Cluster Computing** is one of the most absorbing innovations in the recent past. A computer cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software. It is quite impossible for independent researchers to afford a costly super-computer and exploit all its benefits. Our project focuses on basic implementation of small cluster computing. To optimize performance with minimal cost we will try to address issues of software choice , configuration, networking and implementation of algorithms for dedicated tasks.
#### We will also try to learn about various data dependencies in a given program and splitting independent units to make the system inherently parallel and thus optimizing the execution time.
#### **Computer Organization** is the study of internal working , structuring and implementation of a computer system. This project would enable us to expand on the implementation part by maximizing the hardware and software utilities of a single computer.
